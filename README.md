## Project Overview

### Initial Development

The website was initially developed using semantic HTML and DRY CSS principles to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase. The design is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices without horizontal scrollbars. Accessibility considerations were integrated from the start, ensuring the site adheres to WCAG guidelines.

### API Integration

To enhance the functionality of the website, API integration was implemented. The product list and product detail pages were modified to fetch data dynamically from an external API, replacing hardcoded data. This integration includes:

- Dynamic fetching and displaying of products from the API.
- Loading indicators to improve user experience.
- Robust error handling to manage data fetching issues.

### Usability Testing

User testing was conducted to identify and implement improvements in the website's interaction and usability. The process included:

- Planning and conducting usability tests.
- Collecting and analyzing user feedback.
- Implementing enhancements based on the feedback.
- Conducting accessibility testing to ensure ease of use for all users.
